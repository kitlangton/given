# `Δ GIVEN`

A tool for interactively updating your Scala dependencies.

### TODO

- [ ] Use current working directory
- [ ] Support Mill
- [ ] Publish to Homebrew
- [ ] Support project/plugins.sbt
- [ ] Use the current `scalaVersion` to search for dependencies
- [ ] Nicely scroll the view when it's too big
- [ ] Handle weird versioning (e.g., javassist 3.12.1.GA → 3.1.0 Major)
- [ ] Hit 'p' to preview each location in the code + change (ohh, fancy)
